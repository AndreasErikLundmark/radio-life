![radiolifemap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/638d0a7f-dc68-418e-8b2e-26d7e159cf59)

The app consists of two parts, a radio player and a audiofile player/storage.

This is a MPV.. the files user adds to database are ment to be played on the home page. Preferably by switching radio to iPod ui. At the moment user can add, view and delete audiofiles in the library

Upload file handling works like a charm and was taken from here: https://spring.io/guides/gs/uploading-files
